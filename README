This is the source code that runs the meta.krzz.de website. meta.krzz.de is a 
meta URL shortener: you can shorten a URL, and your URL will be sent to a number 
of different URL shorteners. As soon as the shortened URL arrive, they will be 
displayed.

meta.krzz.de is built with the following pieces of software:
- MeToo.pm https://github.com/akrennmair/metoo-pm
- Bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
- Dart http://www.dartlang.org/

The research result about the APIs of the different URL shorteners was 
documented here: https://stratum0.org/mediawiki/index.php/UrlShorteners
